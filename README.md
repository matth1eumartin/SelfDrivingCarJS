# SelfDrivingCarJS

## Description

The neural network in this project was built entirely from scratch with ```0``` libraries used! In this simulation, a neural network learns to control a car that can weave its way through traffic. It does so by using a genetic algorithm that takes the weights of the highest scoring car in the generation before it, before slightly randomizing these weights in order to attempt to improve on the previous generation. Each generation included roughly 1000 cars, but this can cause extreme lag and I would recommend using a smaller car count such as 200 or 500. The right hand side of the screen also includes a visualizer that allows the user to see what inputs are caused by what combination of perceptrons in the network.

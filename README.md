# SelfDrivingCarJS

## Description

This project was built while finetuning a tutorial created by FreeCodecamp, so it isn't included on my website, although I did learn a lot while making it! The neural network in this project was built entirely from scratch with ```0``` libraries used. In this simulation, a neural network learns to control a car that can weave its way through traffic. It does so by using a genetic algorithm that takes the weights of the highest scoring car in the generation before it, before slightly randomizing these weights in order to attempt to improve on the previous generation. Each generation included roughly 1000 cars, but this can cause extreme lag and I would recommend using a smaller car count such as 200 or 500. The right hand side of the screen also includes a visualizer that allows the user to see what inputs are caused by what combination of perceptrons in the network. 

## Accessing the Project

Downloading all files in the repository and running the home.html file should be enough as there are no external libaries used in this project. You need to manually save the best car output by clicking the floppy disk in the middle of the screen (this can get a bit fiddly), and if this output is not good enough, you can delete it and reset the learning using the bin emoji.
